# The task

The task is to create a Java/Python program that reads a text file where each line contains the coordinates of a multidimensional point and then looks for the closest pair of points in the file. 
If the program has found the closest pair of points, it should output the line numbers and the coordinates of the two closest points.

The text file contains one point per line. 
The coordinate values are separated by a tabulator character. 
The coordinate values are not necessarily integers. 
In the case of a floating-point coordinate value, the decimal separator is a period.
